<h1> INSTALL PYTHON </h1>
<p> Being a Python web framework, Django requires Python. Python includes a lightweight database called SQLite so you won’t need to set up a database just yet.
Get the latest version of Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/ or with your operating system’s package manager.
You can verify that Python is installed by typing python from your shell or terminal</p>
